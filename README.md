<h1> osTicket Part III - Ticket Lifecycle and Assigning Priorities, SLAs, Teams, etc.</h1>
Third and final video in my osTicket project covering the ticketing process of the osTicket software. I demonstrate functions typical of a helpdesk admin role such as setting priorities and SLAs to tickets, assigning tickets and teams, and resolving tickets.
